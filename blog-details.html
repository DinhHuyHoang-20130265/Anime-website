                            <h4>Overview:</h4>
                            <p>After two seasons of this, you kind of already know this is an anime about the Karasuno volleyball team.
                                Season 3 picks up immediately from season 2 and we see the final match to decide whether they get
                               to go to nationals. I've previously reviewed season 1 + 2 of Haikyuu and I have also done episode reviews
                               of seasons 1 + 2. I did not do individual episode reviews for season 3. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">
                            <h4>Review:</h4>
                            <img src="img/blog/details/haikyuu1.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Like my other reviews of Haikyuu and preface it by pointing out I don't much like sport and 
                                it is only recently I started really trying sports anime. Having found a couple of
								them quite watchable I decided to start working my way through some of the more  popular titles 
								and of course ended up watching Haikyuu. On that note, I will point out that if the whole series
                                had been done the way season 3 was, I would have dropped this series very early on.
								That isn't actually saying season 3 is bad, but the entire season (all 10 episodes) follows one
								match of volleyball. Which means, we're watching a very drawn out game between two teams.
								We get occasional flash backs, time out conversations, on court discussions,
								and the occasional commentary from the spectators, but essentially you are watching
								a volleyball game play out in almost real time and if that had been my introduction
								to the series I'd have been out.
							</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog__details__item__text">                     
                            <p>
								So why was I glued to the screen to the point where I didn't even pause to write
								the episode reviews I'd intended?
                            </p>
                        </div>
						<div class="blog__details__item__text">                     
                            <p>
								The main reason is this is such a perfect culmination of everything from season 1 and 2.
								Karasuno have grown and developed as a team and built their skills. Previously we've
								had episodes focussing on individuals but with one exception season 3 focusses on
								the team as a whole and how they are operating. This is no longer the Hinata and Kageyama
								show with their weird combination that lucks out some points due to surprising
								the opponent. This is now very much a cohesive group working with each person's
								strengths and the skills they learned through everything we'd watched previously employed
								for the best possible outcome. Of course, that isn't to say that Hinata and Kageyama don't get
								their moments. They certainly do make their presence in the team felt.
                            </p>

                            <p>
								The one exception is Tsukishima. He's been one of my favourite characters from early
								on (something about his common sense and sarcasm just really hit the mark) but
								in season 3 he really becomes a part of the team and he just shines. The coach isn't lying
								 at the end of the game when he says that Tsukishima is definitely the MVP. Whether it is
								 strategizing, stepping up his own game, finally finding the determination to go all out
								 , to the point where he even questions why he cares so much, everything about him 
								 during this game is just perfect and he really steals several moments in this season.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
								Despite being glued to the screen though, I do have some criticisms or at least some thoughts
								on things that weren't quite so amazing. They didn't take away how great it was 
								to see the Karasuno players from playing this game but they do take some of
								the shine off the show after the fact when you sit back and reflect on it.
                            </p>
                        </div>

							 <img src="img/blog/details/haikyuu3.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
								The first of these is the opening theme. It works and the imagery is actually really well
								done and is on par with previous seasons visuals. So watching it is fine. The song itself
								though, while not in any way bad, doesn't quite have the same impact that earlier openings
								 have had and given how hyped up everything else in this show was, it felt just a little bit
								 lacking at the start of each new episode.
								
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
								Another issue I had was with the opponent. The team from Shiratorizawa are probably the 
								least interesting team we've met in this three season run of this show. Previous opponents have had
								the stand out characters and fun personalities or formed interesting rivalries with cast members.
								You've actually felt a bit bad for some of them when the plot inevitably turned on them so that
								Karasuno could continue on their way to being the protagonists of the sports show. You don't get
								this from Shiratorizawa, although I get from some of the flash backs and things they are trying
								to help us care about this group. Really, other than the ace and the red head (and I don't actually
								remember either name), I couldn't actually recall any of the players from the opposition even the day
								after I finished viewing this. They had almost no impact. Sure, they were great at volleyball and some
								of the rallies and plays were cool to watch. But as characters they were just opponents. The next rock 
								blocking the pathway for the team we actually care about.
								
                            </p>
                        </div>
						<div class="blog__details__item__text"> 
							 <img src="img/blog/details/haikyuu5.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
								Nowhere was this more clearly highlighted than when we saw Oikawa in the stands. Here is an opponent
								we actually cared about and even as a bystander and occasional commentator, he is still more
								interesting than the other team on the court. Given how few episodes most opponents got in Haikyuu
								, it seems a little wrong that the team that had nearly ten episodes actually felt the least
								fleshed out. And maybe this was deliberate. The coaches were competing ideologically with
								brute strength vs flexibility so maybe the wooden personalities of the opponents (red head was
								an exception here) was an actual choice to highlight that difference, but it doesn't make them any more
								interesting or memorable.
								
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
								I'm glad I made it through to the end of this (though is that sequel bait going on at the end of did
								I just not get that). I enjoyed my time with these characters and had a few laughs and smiles
								along the way. It didn't blow me away or become my new favourite anime and I think my emotional
								attachment to these characters is pretty fleeting, but I kind of get now why so many people enjoyed 
								this anime. It is good fun and there are some really great moments along the way.
